# About
**CricBoss** is a web based application. Aiming to various cricket academies, the goal of this project is to make a web platform which will sort out the best list of players of a certain organisation. **CricBoss** is made for the cricket academies so that they can have the best possible team on their turf.

# How it works
**Cricboss** registers the academies and registers the players of that academy under its name. All of those data are stored in a database. The database is regularly updated when the player data is updated for regular match. CricBoss uses statistical analysis to find the following parameters - `Batting Average` and `Strike Rate` for batsman, and `Bowling Average`and `Rate`For bowlers. Basing on these parameters using statistical analysis a sorted list of the top batsman and bowlers are given.

# Codes
## Front End
For front end `Javascript`, `HTML` and `CSS` are used.
## Back End
For back a relational database is created. `MySQL` is used for making the database and tables. All the records are stored in this database.
